# Pyspark-
This is a repository of one of the most interesting Pyspark codes that we have worked on during my NoSQL for Business class. "Movie similarities.py" is a code that reads information from thousands of movie ratings through the "u.base" file. It then generates reocmmendations with percent accuracy and strength values of movies that relate to a particular movie title you search for.
